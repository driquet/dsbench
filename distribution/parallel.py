Description: Parallel way to distribute portscan

             Parallel distribution consists in:
                * divide the whole set containing (targets, ports) into subparts,
                * start firewalls monitor
                * distribute these subparts between scanners,
                * wait for events and process them

             Events can be:
                * the scanner has finished its work, we give it work it there is left,
                * or one of the firewall has detected a scanner, and we have to stop it.
